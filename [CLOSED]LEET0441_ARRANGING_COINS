"""
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.n is a non-negative integer 
and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.Example 1: n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2: n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
